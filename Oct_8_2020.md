#  Python NumPy Arrays
## Chapter 6 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'NumPy Arrays'

The Numpy module, which is readily installed with my Python distributions, is designed to work with large data sets, particularly those with multiple dimensions. However, unlike Python lists and tuples, NumPy arrays cannot hold multiple data types. For example, a defined numpy array must be all floating numbers, strings, integers, ect....  Despite this rule, it is much more computationally efficient to work with NumPy arrays than with lists/tuples. For this lecture, we will learn how to: 
- Create arrays
- Review common NumPy data types
- Go over useful array functions
- Discuss array indexing and subsetting
- Learn how to reshape arrays
- Combine logical operators with arrays

**Note:** There are *ALOT* of things you can do with NumPy arrays, so for the purpose of time, we will not be abe to go over every function/trick related to NumPy arrays. *It will be up to you* to read the DeCaria book and review other online resources! This lecture is meant to give you the tools so that you can work with basic NumPy arrays.

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture!

# Creating an array

**Opening files:** There are many ways one can create an array using NumPy. The most simple way to this is supply NumPy's array function and give it a list/tuple as its input. Before starting, you must load the NumPy module:

    import numpy as np
    
then, we can create a 1D array by doing the following:
    
    a = np.array([1,5,3,-6,-2,4,-9,2,2])
        
The array that we created will be all integers, since we only supplied it with integer values. 

    type(a)
    >> <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    
    type(a[0])
    >> <class 'numpy.int64'>

However, we can also create an array and predefine the data type using the `dtype` agrument:

    a = np.array([1,5,3,-6,-2,4,-9,2,2],dtype=np.float64)
    
    type(a[0])
    >> <class 'numpy.float64'>
    
Here, you can see that the first element in array a is now a floating number.

<br><br>
Listed below are the data typs most commonly used within NumPy arrays:

>- `np.float`: Double percision (64 bit) floating point
>- `np.int64`: Double percision (64 bit) integer
>- `np.complex128`: Complex number, with a real and imaginary part that are each 64 bits
>- `np.bool_`: Boolean (True/False) data type. Note the underscore `_`. 

<br><br>

You can also create 2-D arrays (or other multidimensional arrays) by inserting nested lists/tuples as the input for `np.array` function...

    a = np.array([[2,5],[1,-4]])
    
    print(a)
    >> array([[ 2,  5],
              [ 1, -4]])


Finally, you can also create arrays using single values:

    a_zero = np.zeros((10,10))
    
    print(a_zero)
    
    >> array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    >>        [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    ....
    >>        [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    >>        [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])


or


    a_nan = np.empty((10,10))
    a_nan[:] = np.nan 
    
    print(a_nan)
    
    >> array([[nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],
              [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],
              ...
              [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],
              [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan]])


Personally, I like using NaN arrays when I want to fill in the data later on...

# Sequential arrays






⚠️⚠️ Note that parts of section 6.3 from the DeCaria textbook is slightly outdated, as the `next` method became depreciated in Python versions newer than 3.3. `readline()` has replaced `next`. ⚠️⚠️
