#  Python NumPy Arrays
## Chapter 6 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'NumPy Arrays'

The Numpy module, which is readily installed with my Python distributions, is designed to work with large data sets, particularly those with multiple dimensions. However, unlike Python lists and tuples, NumPy arrays cannot hold multiple data types. For example, a defined numpy array must be all floating numbers, strings, integers, ect....  Despite this rule, it is much more computationally efficient to work with NumPy arrays than with lists/tuples. For this lecture, we will learn how to: 
- Create arrays
- Review common NumPy data types
- Go over useful array functions
- Discuss array indexing and subsetting
- Learn how to reshape arrays
- Combine logical operators with arrays

**Note:** There are *ALOT* of things you can do with NumPy arrays, so for the purpose of time, we will not be abe to go over every function/trick related to NumPy arrays. *It will be up to you* to read the DeCaria book and review other online resources! This lecture is meant to give you the tools so that you can work with basic NumPy arrays.

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture!

# Creating an array

**Opening files:** There are many ways one can create an array using NumPy. The most simple way to this is supply NumPy's array function and give it a list/tuple as its input. Before starting, you must load the NumPy module:

    import numpy as np
    
then, we can create a 1D array by doing the following:
    
    a = np.array([1,5,3,-6,-2,4,-9,2,2])
        
The array that we created will be all integers, since we only supplied it with integer values. 

    type(a)
    >> <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    
    type(a[0])
    >> <class 'numpy.int64'>

However, we can also create an array and predefine the data type using the `dtype` agrument:

    a = np.array([1,5,3,-6,-2,4,-9,2,2],dtype=np.float64)
    
    type(a[0])
    >> <class 'numpy.float64'>
    
Here, you can see that the first element in array a is now a floating number.

<br><br>
Listed below are the data typs most commonly used within NumPy arrays:

>- `np.float`: Double percision (64 bit) floating point
>- `np.int64`: Double percision (64 bit) integer
>- `np.complex128`: Complex number, with a real and imaginary part that are each 64 bits
>- `np.bool_`: Boolean (True/False) data type. Note the underscore `_`. 

<br><br>

You can also create 2-D arrays (or other multidimensional arrays) by inserting nested lists/tuples as the input for `np.array` function...

    a = np.array([[2,5],[1,-4]])
    
    print(a)
    >> array([[ 2,  5],
              [ 1, -4]])


Finally, you can also create arrays using single values:

    a_zero = np.zeros((10,10))
    
    print(a_zero)
    
    >> array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    >>        [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    ....
    >>        [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    >>        [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])


or


    a_nan = np.empty((10,10))
    a_nan[:] = np.nan 
    
    print(a_nan)
    
    >> array([[nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],
              [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],
              ...
              [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan],
              [nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan]])


Personally, I like using NaN arrays when I want to fill in the data later on...

# Sequential arrays

There are 3 functions that are primarily used to generate sequential arrays in Python. These functions are `arange()`, `linspace()`, and `logspace()`. The `arange()` function behaves very similarly to the `range()` function in Python:

    seq_array = np.arange(0,11,2)
    
    print(seq_array)
    >> [ 0  2  4  6  8 10]
    
    seq_array = np.arange(11,0,-2)
    
    print(seq_array)
    >> [11  9  7  5  3  1]
    
And you get the idea... The data type of the array is determined by the input. So if all the inputs are integers, it will be an integer-type data array. Note that you can define the dtype argument when using the `np.arange` function.

<br><br>

The `linspace()` function allows the user to specify a begining and end value and the number of points to create:

    seq_array = np.linspace(1,10,30)
    
    print(seq_array)
    >> array([ 1.        ,  1.31034483,  1.62068966,  1.93103448,  2.24137931,
    >>         2.55172414,  2.86206897,  3.17241379,  3.48275862,  3.79310345,
    ...
               7.20689655,  7.51724138,  7.82758621,  8.13793103,  8.44827586,
    >>         8.75862069,  9.06896552,  9.37931034,  9.68965517, 10.        ])


<br><br>

Finally, the `np.logspace()` function works similar to the `linspace()` function, but here, the values are spaced logarithmically. See the DeCaria text for more example on this!

# Indexing and subsetting arrays

Specific elements in an array can be accessed by indexing or subsetting Python NumPy arrays, similar to that of lists/tuples. For multidimensional arrays, the different dimensions are seperated by commas. The first index often refers to the row of the array, while the second index refers to the column. For 3 dimensional arrays, the 3rd index would represent the height, and so on...

⚠️ Note: *Technically*, subsetting an array and saving it to a variable does not create a new copy of it, essentially it is just a pointer to the original array. This ultimately saves memory for the computer, which can be important when working with large data sets. This does not change anything for the purposes of this class, more or less this is just good to know. This is referred to as a *shallow* copy. If you must copy an array, you can use the `np.copy()` function, but this is rarely needed. 

Here are some example on how to index arrays wich is similar to indexing tuples/lists. In the most part should be review... ;-)

    seq_array = np.arange(0,11,2)
    
    print(seq_array)
    >> array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10])
    
    print(seq_array[3])
    >> 6
    
    print(seq_array[3:])
    >> [ 6  8 10]
    
    print(seq_array[-1])
    >> [10]
    
<br><br>

And some striding examples...

    seq_array = np.arange(0,21,1)
    
    print(seq_array)
    >> array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,17, 18, 19, 20])
    
    
    print(seq_array[0:12:2])
    >> array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10])
    
    
    print(seq_array[::-1])
    >> [20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0]
    
    
    print(seq_array[::-2])
    >> [20 18 16 14 12 10  8  6  4  2  0]
    
    
And you get the idea...!

<br><br>

Finally, it is also possible to index with lists, which can be very useful:

    my_list = [0,2,4,6,8,10]
    
    print(seq_array[my_list])
    >> array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10])

This is useful, especially when utilizing the `where()` function. More on this later!


<br><br>

Indexing multidimensional arrays is very similar to that of 1-D arrays, except that there are 2 or more dimensions that you need to consider. For example, lets say I wanted to grab the first element of a 2D array (upper left corner or the '1'):

    array_2D = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
    
    print(array_2D) 
    >> array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])
              
    print(array_2D[0,0])
    >> 1

What if I want to grab the top middle index (the '2')?

    print(array_2D[0,1])
    >> 2
    
What is I wanted to grab the entire middle row (4, 5, 6)?

    print(array_2D[1,:])
    >> [4 5 6]
    

What if I wanted to subset for the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8?

    print(array_2D[1:3,1:3])
    >> array([[5, 6],
              [8, 9]])

Is there another way we can index this? There is more than one solution!

<br><br>

And what if we wanted to grab the left middle value of our array (the '4')? *You tell me the answer!*
