#  Plotting

Reading in and manipulating data is great, however, visualizing this data in some shape or form is often the end result for most programs! In this lecture we will learn how to plot up that data and edit different plotting elements to make our plots more visually appealing.
- We learn how to make a simple 1-D line plot
- Adjust different elements in our line plot 
- Plot data from the dateframe that we were working with last week.
- Visualize data in other ways such as histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots.

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture!
