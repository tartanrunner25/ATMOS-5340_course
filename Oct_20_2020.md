> # Announcement: 
> Your 5th programming assignment on Panda, Numpy Arrays, and plotting is **due this Sunday.**

> # Today's Objective
> Introduction to plotting with Python using the Matplotlib library
> Create simple 1-D plots
> Adjust plotting elemements
> Plot data from a Pandas Dateframe
> Review other types of plots
<br><br>


#  Plotting

Reading in and manipulating data is great, however, visualizing this data in some shape or form is often the end result for most programs! In this lecture we will learn how to plot up that data and edit different plotting elements to make our plots more visually appealing.
- We learn how to make a simple 1-D line plot
- Adjust different elements in our line plot 
- Plot data from the dateframe that we were working with last week.
- Visualize data in other ways such as histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots.

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture!

#  Basic plotting

Before we can start plotting data, we must import the matplotlib plotting library, which contains classes and functions for creatig MATLAB-style plots and graphs. We will primarily be working with the `pyplot` submodule for today's lecture. In addition, lets go ahead and import NumPy and Pandas, since we will be utilizing functions from those modules as well.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    

Lets create a dummy data set to initially work with before we start working with 'real' data. Using NumPy, create the following 1-D array:

    x = np.arange(0,100.5,0.5)
    y = 2.0*np.sqrt(x) 
    plt.plot(x,y)
    plt.show()

What happened? Were you able to generate the plot on the right?
