> # Announcement: 
> Your 5th programming assignment on Panda, Numpy Arrays, and plotting is **due in two weeks.**

> # Today's Objective
> Introduce Python's Pandas library
> Discuss why we would want to use Pandas
> Reading in data with Pandas
> Use Pandas to manipulate some basic data sets
<br><br>


#  Python Pandas

Pandas is a data manipulation tool built on Python's Numpy module. Pandas introduces two new data type structures. The first data structure type is a Pandas *series*, which is a one dimensional array. The second data structure is a *'dataframe'*, which is similar to a 2-D NumPy array, except that it can hold multiple data types within it (strings, floats, integers, datetime objects, ect...). This features make Pandas particularly good for working with time series data. In addition, I've always found reading in text and csv data rather annoying in Python, but Pandas makes this task MUCH easier! For today, we will: 
- Read csv-formatted data into Python 
- Learn how to subset and slice dataframes 
- Aggegrate and group data
- Work with time objects in Pandas
- While not discussed here, plotting data from a Pandas dataframe is super easy! (We will learn about Python plotting next week)

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture!
