Python is a popular general-purpose computer programming language invented by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1990.

Python has grown into one of the top 3 most-popular programming languages, ranked by usage: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/.

It is heavily used by many companies including Google, Dropbox, Netflix, Spotify, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, etc. and, of course, in environmental science. There have been many tweets about Hurricane Dorian today. Many of the graphics appear to be made with Python.

With a just a little bit of elbow grease you can make some really terrific plots using python! The plotting options in python are truely limitless.

## Stepping back for a second, why programming?
Learning a new language sounds really difficult! I am already a Microsoft Excel wiz kid, why can't I just use that for my number crunching?
- Data sets used in the Atmospheric Sciences are often very large
- A simple CSV file with weather station data can easily have millions of lines
- Numerical weather prediction data and other environmental data sets are often provided in compressed file formats not readable by Excel
- Even then, these data sets often contains a hundred million data points or more...
- Its difficult to automate processes with Excel and other spreadsheet applications!
- Ultimately, programming is quicker, *and easier* once you have become proficient with a specific language 
    - Learning your first langage is always the toughest part and learning subsequent languages is generally MUCH easier
- Programming is potentially a lifelong skill that will ultimately make you more employable depending on your career path


## Why use Python?
- Python software is **open source**, meaning that people can freely modify and share it.
- Python **syntax**, or the programing language's "grammar rules", is relatively intuitive compared to other languages. 
- Python Code can be easier to read due to formatting conventions. 
    - e.g., indented code blocks.
- Code is **interpreted** rather than **compiled**.  
    - Interpreted code runs slower, but is easier to write and debug.
- Python is relatively easy to learn. There is abundant documentation and learning material available online.
- More environmental science is being done in Python.
 - Python is object-oriented. Everything is an object. This makes coding very flexible but can also be confusing. We'll tend to use Python in a procedural-programming context that should minimize the confusion.

# Python 2 vs 3
Differences in coding are relatively minor but can create issues.
- Version 2.7 remains heavily used, but support for it is _rapidly_ being deprecated.
    - How much time is left? [Python 2.7 Retirement Count Down](https://pythonclock.org/)
    - Spoiler... Time is up!
- **Version 3.7**, or higher, is what you should be using.

Python 3.7 has already been installed for you! However, if you are feeling adventurous, you could install Python 3 on your own computer!
- For [Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)<br>
- For [PC](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)<br>


> Note: When searching for online programming help, be aware of the two different versions and look for answers for Python 3.


A few more things about Python
- Python is dynamically typed
    - Variables generally do not need to be declared before using them (i.e real, string, integer)
- Python has a robust built-in set of data types, and users are free to define additional structures.
- Python is **case sensitive**.
    - Pressure, pressure, PRESSURE will be 3 completely different variables!
- Python is object oriented 
    - A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures

# Terminology
You need to become familiar with terms used typically for all programming languages

| Term | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|
|Script|A file that contains one or more lines of Python code. Ends with the file exension `.py`.| `filename.py`
|Code| Program content 
|Package or Module or Library|Something you import that contains a collection of functions and methods that perform useful actions without writing the code yourself.|`import numpy`
|Statement| Instruction to a computer.| A line of code.
|Assignment| A statement that binds an expression (object) to a variable (name)| `=`
|Object| Anything that a variable can be referred to | a number, string, list, array, function, etc.
|Variable| Name of an assigned object. |
|Expression| Combo of numbers, text, variables, and operators that result in a new object when evaluated| `y = mx+b`
|Function| A block of statements used to create a new object
|Argument| A value passed to a function.| For the statement `max([1,9,5])`.<br> The object inside the `()` is the argument.
|Algorithm| Recipe for how to solve a problem
|Executable| File used to run a programs | `python`, `jupyter lab`
|Verification| Providing evidence that the program works correctly
|Debugging| Locating and correcting errors in a programs

# Syntax and data types

**Reminder**: Recall, Python is case-sensitive! PRESSURE, pressure, and Pressure are *NOT* the same variables. Similarly, this also applies to functions as well. For example, the function print() will print out the value assigned to a variable, while Print() would result in an error, unless the user defined their own function named 'Print'.

    a = 1
    print(a)
    >>1
    Print(a)
    >>Traceback (most recent call last):
    >>File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    >>NameError: name 'Print' is not defined

**Other notes about print:** This is a useful command for print out the values of variables to the command line. This is particularly useful when debugging code!

**Function:** A function is a command that allows python (or any other programming) to peform an automated task, which internally consists of a number of Python commands (under the hood). For example, the function np.mean() will compute the mean of values assigned to the function. The assignment of values to a function is referred to as an 'argument'. Users can also define their own arguments if there is a particular, repeatable task that needs to be carried out. A deeper analysis on 'functions' will be presented in **Chapter 8** of the DeCaria text.

    values = [1,2,3,4,5]
    np.mean(values)
    >> 3.0
