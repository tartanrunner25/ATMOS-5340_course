#  Python Mathematical operators and functions
## Chapter 3 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Strings'

In programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.
- Strings are normally enclosed using single, double, or triple quotation marks
- Quotes used the start and end of a string must match
- Strings are considered 'literals' in that they have no special meaning or numeric representation.
- Quotations within a string are valid, if the quotations used to enclose the string is different than the quotations *within* the string
    - "This string is going to work" and "This string isn't going to cause problems either" or 'Derek says "Hello"' are all valid
- Like numeric data types, string can also be manipulated within Python.


**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

# Operators
You can use Python much like a calculator. Type the following statements and press `enter` to run the line of code:   
<!---->
    1+2
<!---->
    1/2
<!---->
    2**2
<!---->  
    5%2
> ## Do it yourself
> Try different numbers and find out what each of the operators do.
>- What does the `+` operator do?   
>- What does the `-` operator do?   
>- What does the `*` operator do?   
>- What does the `/` operator do?   
>- What does `//` operator do?  
>- What does the `**` operator do?  
>- What does the `%` "modulo" operator do?

# Variables
In math/physics, variables are often part of equations/formulas. In computing languages, variables are much more flexible and can be assigned a value, then reused with a different value, etc.

Variables are names that values are assigned to with the `=` operator. In programing, `=` means "assigned to" _not_ "equals".

A variable is a value of some quantity, but to describe it requires:
- a name
- a storage location

Normally, the variable name references the stored value. Keeping the name and content separately allows the name to be used independently of the information it represents.

When a program executes, the name is bound by the computer source code to a value but the value of the variable may change during program execution.
