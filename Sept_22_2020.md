#  Python Mathematical Operators and Functions
## Chapter 4 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Mathematical Operators and Functions'

Operators are the commands that manipulate the values of variables, especially for numeric data types.
- Can be used to change the value of an object using basic math operators ( + - x / )
- There are also operators, which can truncate, compare, and round.
- More sophisticated math functions can performed using the numpy module (trigonometry, exponentials/logarithms, inverse trig. and hyperbolic, and other numeric functions.

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

# Operators
You can use Python much like a calculator. Type the following statements and press `enter` to run the line of code:   
<!---->
    1+2
<!---->
    1/2
<!---->
    2**2
<!---->  
    5%2
> ## Do it yourself
> Try different numbers and find out what each of the operators do.
>- What does the `+` operator do?   
>- What does the `-` operator do?   
>- What does the `*` operator do?   
>- What does the `/` operator do?   
>- What does `//` operator do?  
>- What does the `**` operator do?  
>- What does the `%` "modulo" operator do?

# Variable Assignment
In math/physics, variables are often part of equations/formulas. In computing languages, variables are much more flexible and can be assigned a value, then reused with a different value, etc.

Variables are names that values are assigned to with the `=` operator. In programing, `=` means "assigned to" _not_ "equals".

A variable is a value of some quantity, but to describe it requires:
- a name
- a storage location

Normally, the variable name references the stored value. Keeping the name and content separately allows the name to be used independently of the information it represents.

When a program executes, the name is bound by the computer source code to a value but the value of the variable may change during program execution.

|Rules for Variable Names| Example|
|--|--|
|Can be a combos of letters and numbers.|`alpha3`, `Timer8`
|Names are case sensitive.|`Pressure` is different from `pressure` and `PRESSURE`
|Must start with a letter.| Good: `var1 = 5` <br> Bad: `1var = 5`
|Can use underscores.| `potential_temperature`|
|Should be descriptive.| `temp` or `temperature` is better than `t`.|
|By convention, use all CAPS for constants:| `TEMP_0C_IN_K = 273.15`

> Note: There are 32 keyword names that are reserved becuase they have special meaning in Python. Variable names cannot be words like `del`, `and`, `if`, `global`, `for`, etc.

We can assign values to a variable and use the variables in expressions.

    # Calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = (a**2 + b**2)**(1/2)
    print(c)

 >Note: The `#` symbol indicates the line is a comment and not code. Everything in the line after the symbol is disregarded when the line of code is run.

## Do it Yourself
Try assigning a few variables and add the variables together.

    # Convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit
    temp_c = 10
    temp_f = temp_c * 9/5 + 32

## Check out a simple Python script. What does it do?

## Boolean Types

**Recall that booleans are either `True`  or `False`**. 
  
- True is equivalent to 1 or 1.0
- False is equivalent to 0 or 0.0

Try: 

    bool(0)
    bool(3)
    bool(1-1)
    type(bool(1-1))

Booleans are often used with "comparison operators".

### Comparison operators
- Return boolean values of True or False
- You can compare integer, floats, and strings

|Description|Operator|
|--|--|
|Equal to| == |
| Not equal to | != |
| Less than | < |
| Greater than | > |
| Greater than or equal to | >= |
| Less than or equal to | <= |

Try:

    5 > 9           # Great than
    10 == 3         # Equal to
    12 <= 100       # Less than or equal to
    12 != 3.4       # Not equal to
    
    b = 3 > 8
    print(b)
    type(b)

### 🏈 Did Utah beat BYU last Thursday?

    # Utah and BYU scores by quarter
    Utah_q1 = 3
    Utah_q2 = 6
    Utah_q3 = 7
    Utah_q4 = 14

    BYU_q1 = 0
    BYU_q2 = 6
    BYU_q3 = 0
    BYU_q4 = 6

    Utah_final = Utah_q1 + Utah_q2 + Utah_q3 + Utah_q4
    BYU_final = BYU_q1 + BYU_q2 + BYU_q3 + BYU_q4

    print('Did Utah beat BYU last Thursday?')
    print(Utah_final>BYU_final)
    print('Final Score: Utah', Utah_final, '--','BYU', BYU_final)

## Numpy

In addition to doing basic math and comparison operators, Python has the ability to perform slightly more complicated tasks using the *Numpy module*. Numpy stands for the Numerical Python module, which expands upons the basic functions are features that comes with the base version of Python. Most distributions of Python already include this module, so often times you do not need to install this on your own!

To activate the Numpy module, do the following command:

     import numpy as np 
     
This command simply tells Python to load the *Numpy module* and denote this package as *np*, where is a shorthand version of Numpy. Whenever you use a function from Numpy, you will need to follow the function with a `numpy.<function>`. With the above shortcut, we can call a numpy function with `np.<function>`, which is shorter, and more elegant looking. 

Through Numpy, we can do things like Trignometry or work with exponentials or logarithmic numbers. Numpy also comes with some useful tools for rounding numbers, computing the absolute value, or doing something as simple as taking a mean. 

Listed below are some examples of useful Numpy functions:

    import numpy as np
    
    print(np.pi)                    #Returns constant for pi
    >> 3.141592653589793
    
    print(np.e)
    >> 2.718281828459045            #Returns constant for e
    
    print(np.log(10))               #Returns the natural log of x or 10 in this case. Equivalent to ln(x)
    >> 4.605170185988092
    
    print(np.log10(10))             #Returns the base 10 logarithm of x
    >> 1.0
    
    print(np.ceil(10.76342))        #Returns the nearest, highest integer
    >> 11.0
    
    print(np.floor(10.76342))       #Returns the nearest, lower-most integer
    >> 10.0
    
    print(np.abs(-22.61))           #Returns the absolite value of -22.61
    >> 22.61
    
    #Computes the average of a Python list, tuple, or array
    class_grades = [92,86,78,84,81,70,96,88,80,79,74,88,95]
    avg_grades = np.mean(class_grades)
    print(avg_grades)
    
    >> 83.92307692307692
    
    #Computes the median
    med_grades = np.median(class_grades)
    print(med_grades)
    >> 85.0
    
    print(np.round(avg_grades,2))    #Rounds our number to the decimal place specified in the argument on the right (2)
    >> 83.92
    
    print(np.max(class_grades))      #Computes max value in our list
    >> 96.0
    
You get the idea.... Refer to the DeCaria text for **Chapter 4** for a list of many more useful Numpy functions!
    

Finally, these are also functions to find NaN values, which are commonly used in the sciences to flag erroneous data or missing data.

For example....

    temp_slc = [76,77,77,80,82,85,90,94,96,97,98,99,99,97,93,88,87,np.nan]  
    print(temp_slc)
    >> [76, 77, 77, 80, 82, 85, 90, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99, 97, 93, 88, 87, nan]
    
    print(np.isnan(temp_slc))
    >> array([False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False,  True])
