> # Announcement: 
> Your 5th programming assignment on Panda, Numpy Arrays, and plotting is **due in two weeks.**

> Reading in data with Pandas
> Use Pandas to manipulate some basic data sets
<br><br>


#  Python Pandas

Pandas is a data manipulation tool built on Python's Numpy module. Pandas introduces two new data type structures. The first data structure type is a Pandas *series*, which is a one dimensional array. The second data structure is a *'dataframe'*, which is similar to a 2-D NumPy array, except that it can hold multiple data types within it (strings, floats, integers, datetime objects, ect...). This features make Pandas particularly good for working with time series data. In addition, I've always found reading in text and csv data rather annoying in Python, but Pandas makes this task MUCH easier! For today, we will: 
- Read csv-formatted data into Python 
- Learn how to subset and slice dataframes 
- Aggegrate and group data
- Work with time objects in Pandas
- While not discussed here, plotting data from a Pandas dataframe is super easy! (We will learn about Python plotting next week)

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture!

#  Reading in data

As a starting point, lets load the appriopriate libraries for working with Pandas:

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd


For the purpose of this class, we will mostly be working with *dataframes* as we will mostly be working with 2D data sets. As a first step, lets fire up a linux session on a seperate tab, and copy the following file into your working directory. For todays lecture, it may be a good idea to create a directory called `module7_lecture` and then `cd` into it.

    mkdir module7_lecture
    cd module7_lecture
    cp /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/u0703457/public_html/dereks_homepage/Atmos_5340/class_files/module7_zoo.csv .


Now, lets return to our Jupyter notebook session. <br>
<br>
To read in a csv file, we will be using the `pd.read.csv()` function, which is similar to Python's default csv function, except that it is a bit less cumbersome to use! This function has a number of arguments that will allow this code to deal all sorts of csv files. For this lecture, we will just focus on a few key arguments:

>- filepath_or_buffer 
>- sep 
>- header 
>- header
>- dtype
>- skiprows
