#  Python Loops and Conditional Statements
## Chapter 5 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Flow Control'

Loops are often used to iterating through a sequeunce, list, dictionary, tuple, or an array. Conditional statements, often using booleans, can be employed to determine when a specific code block should be executed (or skipped).
- `For` and `while` loops primarily used to iterate over an *idented* block of code 
- Conditional statements, or `if` statements are often used to determine whether a block of code should be executed or not
- There are also additional use commands in Python that allows the programmer to control a loop or conditional statement

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

# Conditional statements

Conditional statements are used to execute a specific block of code, if specific conditions are met. Conditional statements almost always start with an *if construct*.

    if condition is met:
        execute the following lines of code
    
    #end of if statement block

Generally conditional statements are checked using mathematical logical conditions.

Recall: 

>- Equals: a == b
>- Not Equals: a != b
>- Less than: a < b
>- Less than or equal to: a <= b
>- Greater than: a > b
>- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

If statements can also be embedded with Python loops, which we will go over later in this lecture...

For cases where there are multiple conditions, an *if else* `elif` syntax can be added to the first condition:

    if condition is met:
        execute the following lines of code
    if else do we meet this condition?:
        execute this block
    if else do we meet this condition?:
        execute this block
    
    #end of if statement block
    
**Note** There are no limits to how many elif statements can be used!

Finally, an `else` construct can be used at the end of if conditional statement to execute lines of code for cases where none of the prior conditions are met. For example

    if condition is met:
        execute the following lines of code
    else:
        execute this line of code instead
    
    #end of if statement block

<br><br>

Lets look at some lines of *actual* python code that utilizes conditional statements like the ones we went over above! 

    temp = 30
    
    if temp <= 32:
        print('The temperature is at or below freezing')
        
>> What happens here?

    temp = 50
    
    if temp <= 32:
        print('The temperature is at or below freezing')
        
 
        
<br><br>
Since our temperature variable 'temp' does not meet the criteria of our `if` statement, it skips the lines of code within our `if` statement block.

❗❗❗❗ Do not forget to add a colon `:` after each `if`, `elif`, and `else` construct


Here is an example of an `if` statement with a else construct:

    temp = 30
    
    if temp <= 32:
        print('The temperature is at or below freezing')
    else:
        print('The temperature is above freezing!')
        
    >> The temperature is at or below freezing

<br><br>

And here is an example of an `if` statement with an if else construct:

    #Thunderstorm probability
    tstorm = 30
    
    if 20 >= tstorm:
        print('Little to no chance of thunderstorms today')
    elif 20 < tstorm <= 40:
        print('Slight chance of thunderstorms today')
    elif 40 < tstorm <= 60:
        print('Chance of thunderstorms today')
    elif 60 < tstorm:
        print('Thunderstorms are likely today')
        
>> What do you think the result will be here?!

<br><br>

Conditional statements can also be written as a single line. This is only recommended if the code within the if/else statement is particurly short.

    [expression 1] if condition else [expression 2]
    
For example:

    temp = 30
    print('temperature at or below freezing') if temp <= 32 else print('Temperature above freezing')
    
    >> The temperature is at or below freezing

# Loops

There are two types of loops used by Python. This includes `for` and `while` loops.

`for` loops always require an iterable object and has a similar syntax as a conditional statement. 

    for var in iterable object:
        do stuff in
        this line for 
        each iteration 
        that we are 
        looping through
        
    #end of for loop
        

In this syntax *iterable object* represents an iterable object that is being loop through, while  *var* hold the value of the 
current value of the iterable object. The python code block within the `for` loop will be performed for each iteration being performed. 
The number of iterations will be equal to the number of elements within the iterable object. 

Lets look at an example:

    temp = [36,38,40,44,48,53,60,62,64,65,65,63,60,55,50] 

    for T in temp:
        print(T)
        
    >> 36
    >> 38
    >> 40
    >> 44
    .......
    >> 50
        
When we run this block of code, Python iterate through each element within our object 'temp'. In this loop we have told Python to run the print statement for each iterable element (T) in temperature. 

<br><br>
You can also can also use a prefined range object as a iterable object. 

    for c in range(0,10):
       print('Counting.... '+str(c))
    
    >> Counting.... 0
    >> Counting.... 1
    >> Counting.... 2
    ....
    >> Counting.... 10

<br><br>
Sometimes, it isuseful to keep track of which iteration we are working on when looping through a variable using the `enumerate` command. Personally, I use this in most of my Python code, especially when I am trouble shooting bugs! For example, there may be a specific iteration where my code breaks, so its always useful to know where this happens!


    temperature = [36,38,40,44,48,53,60,62,64,65,65,63,60,55,50] 
    
    for t, temp in enumerate(temperature):
        print(t,temp)
        
    >> 0 36
    >> 1 38
    >> 2 40
    ...
    >> 14 50

`while` loops are the other looping construct used within Python. This loop runs for as a long as a specific criteria is being met.

    while condition is being met:
        execute this code block
        
    #end while loop
    
For example:
 
    a = 0
    while a < 5:
        print(a)
        a = a + 1
        
    >> 0
    >> 1 
    >> 2
    >> 3
    >> 4
 
This block of code will loop through the above code block until the condition a < 5 is met.

❗❗ Becareful when working with `while` loops as its not difficult to accidently create a loop that runs infinitely! I often refer to this as 'hanging' code, which is common problem, especally with Fortran, which also uses while constructs.

# Other flow control constructs

Sometimes we may want to control a loop if a specific criteria is met within a loop. This often requires combining conditional and looping constructs.

For example, we may want to prematurely end an iteration within a loop if a spefific criteria is met:

    temperature = [60,61,61,58,55,50,44,37,30,28,26,25]
    
    for t,temp in enumerate(temperature):
        if 50 > temp > 30:
            continue
        print(t,temp)
 
    >> 0 60
    >> 1 61
    >> 2 61
    >> 3 58
    >> 4 55
    >> 5 50
    >> 8 30
    >> 9 28
    >> 10 26
    >> 11 25
 
Here, we loop through each element in temperature. For cases where the temperature is less than 50 but greater than 30, the `if` statement condition is triggered. For elements where the `conditional` is met, the `continue` statement within our conditional statement is executed, which tells Python to ignore the lines after the `continue` statement for the iteration we are working on. 


The `break` loop control statement can be used to  prematurelyexit a loop:


    temperature = [60,61,61,58,55,50,44,37,30,28,26,25]
    
    for temp in temperature:
        if 50 > temp > 30:
            break
        print(temp)
    print('Broke out of loop')
 
    >> 60
    >> 61
    >> 61
    >> 58
    >> 55
    >> 50
    >> Broke out of loop

 
The `break` command can be used in conjunction with `for` and `while` loops
