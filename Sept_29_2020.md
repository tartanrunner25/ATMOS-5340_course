#  Python Mathematical Operators and Functions
## Chapter 5 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Flow Control'

Loops are often used to iterating through a sequeunce, list, dictionary, tuple, or an array. Conditional statements, often using booleans, can be employed to determine when a specific code block should be executed (or skipped).
- `For` and `while` loops primarily used to iterate over an *idented* block of code 
- Conditional statements, or `if` statements are often used to determine whether a block of code should be executed or not
- There are also additional use commands in Python that allows the programmer to control a loop or conditional statement

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

# Conditional statements

Conditional statements are used to execute a specific block of code, if specific conditions are met. Conditional statements almost always start with an *if construct*.

    if condition is met:
        execute the following lines of code
    
    #end of if statement block

Generally conditional statements are checked using mathematical logical conditions.

Recall: 

>- Equals: a == b
>- Not Equals: a != b
>- Less than: a < b
>- Less than or equal to: a <= b
>- Greater than: a > b
>- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

If statements can also be embedded with Python loops, which we will go over later in this lecture...

For cases where there are multiple conditions, an *if else* `elif` syntax can be added to the first condition:

    if condition is met:
        execute the following lines of code
    if else if this condition met:
        execute this block
    if else if *this* condition met:
        execute this block
    
    #end of if statement block
    
**Note** There are no limits to how many elif statements can be used!

Finally, an `else` construct can be used at the end of if conditional statement to execute lines of code for cases where none of the prior conditions are met. For example

    if condition is met:
        execute the following lines of code
    else:
        execute this line of code instead
    
    #end of if statement block
    
Lets look at some lines of *actual* python code that utilizes conditional statements like the ones we went over above! 

    temp = 30
    
    if temp <= 32:
        print('The temperature is at or below freezing')
        
>> What happens here?

    temp = 50
    
    if temp <= 32:
        print('The temperature is at or below freezing')
        
 
        

Since our temperature variable 'temp' does not meet the criteria of our `if` statement, it skips the lines of code within our `if` statement block.

❗❗❗❗ Do not forget to add a colon `:` after each `if`, `elif`, and `else` construct


Here is an example of an if statement with a else construct:

    temp = 30
    
    if temp <= 32:
        print('The temperature is at or below freezing')
    else:
        print('The temperature is above freezing!')

And here is an example of an if statement with an if else construct:

    #Thunderstorm probability
    tstorm = 30
    
    if 20 >= tstorm:
        print('Little to no chance of thunderstorms today')
    elif 20 < tstorm <= 40:
        print('Slight chance of thunderstorms today')
    elif 40 < tstorm <= 60:
        print('Chance of thunderstorms today')
    elif 60 < tstorm:
        print('Thunderstorms are likely today')

# Loops



You can use Python much like a calculator. Type the following statements and press `enter` to run the line of code:   
<!---->
    1+2
<!---->
    1/2
<!---->
    2**2
<!---->  
    5%2
> ## Do it yourself
> Try different numbers and find out what each of the operators do.
>- What does the `+` operator do?   
>- What does the `-` operator do?   
>- What does the `*` operator do?   
>- What does the `/` operator do?   
>- What does `//` operator do?  
>- What does the `**` operator do?  
>- What does the `%` "modulo" operator do?

# Variable Assignment
In math/physics, variables are often part of equations/formulas. In computing languages, variables are much more flexible and can be assigned a value, then reused with a different value, etc.

Variables are names that values are assigned to with the `=` operator. In programing, `=` means "assigned to" _not_ "equals".

A variable is a value of some quantity, but to describe it requires:
- a name
- a storage location

Normally, the variable name references the stored value. Keeping the name and content separately allows the name to be used independently of the information it represents.

When a program executes, the name is bound by the computer source code to a value but the value of the variable may change during program execution.

|Rules for Variable Names| Example|
|--|--|
|Can be a combos of letters and numbers.|`alpha3`, `Timer8`
|Names are case sensitive.|`Pressure` is different from `pressure` and `PRESSURE`
|Must start with a letter.| Good: `var1 = 5` <br> Bad: `1var = 5`
|Can use underscores.| `potential_temperature`|
|Should be descriptive.| `temp` or `temperature` is better than `t`.|
|By convention, use all CAPS for constants:| `TEMP_0C_IN_K = 273.15`

> Note: There are 32 keyword names that are reserved becuase they have special meaning in Python. Variable names cannot be words like `del`, `and`, `if`, `global`, `for`, etc.

We can assign values to a variable and use the variables in expressions.

    # Calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = (a**2 + b**2)**(1/2)
    print(c)

 >Note: The `#` symbol indicates the line is a comment and not code. Everything in the line after the symbol is disregarded when the line of code is run.

## Do it Yourself
Try assigning a few variables and add the variables together.

    # Convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit
    temp_c = 10
    temp_f = temp_c * 9/5 + 32
