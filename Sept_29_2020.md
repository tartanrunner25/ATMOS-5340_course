#  Python Mathematical Operators and Functions
## Chapter 5 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Flow Control'

Loops are often used to iterating through a sequeunce, list, dictionary, tuple, or an array. Conditional statements, often using booleans, can be employed to determine when a specific code block should be executed (or skipped).
- `For` and `while` loops primarily used to iterate over an *idented* block of code 
- Conditional statements, or `if` statements are often used to determine whether a block of code should be executed or not
- There are also additional use commands in Python that allows the programmer to control a loop or conditional statement

**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

# Loops
You can use Python much like a calculator. Type the following statements and press `enter` to run the line of code:   
<!---->
    1+2
<!---->
    1/2
<!---->
    2**2
<!---->  
    5%2
> ## Do it yourself
> Try different numbers and find out what each of the operators do.
>- What does the `+` operator do?   
>- What does the `-` operator do?   
>- What does the `*` operator do?   
>- What does the `/` operator do?   
>- What does `//` operator do?  
>- What does the `**` operator do?  
>- What does the `%` "modulo" operator do?

# Variable Assignment
In math/physics, variables are often part of equations/formulas. In computing languages, variables are much more flexible and can be assigned a value, then reused with a different value, etc.

Variables are names that values are assigned to with the `=` operator. In programing, `=` means "assigned to" _not_ "equals".

A variable is a value of some quantity, but to describe it requires:
- a name
- a storage location

Normally, the variable name references the stored value. Keeping the name and content separately allows the name to be used independently of the information it represents.

When a program executes, the name is bound by the computer source code to a value but the value of the variable may change during program execution.

|Rules for Variable Names| Example|
|--|--|
|Can be a combos of letters and numbers.|`alpha3`, `Timer8`
|Names are case sensitive.|`Pressure` is different from `pressure` and `PRESSURE`
|Must start with a letter.| Good: `var1 = 5` <br> Bad: `1var = 5`
|Can use underscores.| `potential_temperature`|
|Should be descriptive.| `temp` or `temperature` is better than `t`.|
|By convention, use all CAPS for constants:| `TEMP_0C_IN_K = 273.15`

> Note: There are 32 keyword names that are reserved becuase they have special meaning in Python. Variable names cannot be words like `del`, `and`, `if`, `global`, `for`, etc.

We can assign values to a variable and use the variables in expressions.

    # Calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = (a**2 + b**2)**(1/2)
    print(c)

 >Note: The `#` symbol indicates the line is a comment and not code. Everything in the line after the symbol is disregarded when the line of code is run.

## Do it Yourself
Try assigning a few variables and add the variables together.

    # Convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit
    temp_c = 10
    temp_f = temp_c * 9/5 + 32

## Check out a simple Python script. What does it do?
