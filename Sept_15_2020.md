# Python Strings
## Chapter 3 from the Alex DeCaria textbook: 'Strings'

In programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.
- Strings are normally enclosed using single, double, or triple quotation marks
- Quotes used the start and end of a string must match
- Strings are considered 'literals' in that they have no special meaning or numeric representation.
- Quotations within a string are valid, if the quotations used to enclose the string is different than the quotations *within* the string
    - "This string is going to work" and "This string isn't going to cause problems either" or 'Derek says "Hello"' are all valid
- Like numeric data types, string can also be manipulated within Python.


**Before starting:** Make sure that you open up a Jupyter notebook session using OnDemand so you can interactively follow along with today's lecture! If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to the previous lecture and class notes.

## Special Characters

Special characters are used in Python to denote formatting commands such as new lines (\n), returns (\r), and tabs (\t). These can be included within a string!

For example, lets say I want to print the Bias and root-mean-square error for a temperature error analysis from a weather forecast model. I can use the new line special character to print the results to a difference line!

    report = 'bias = 2.2 \nRMSE = 3.5'
    print(report)
    >> bias = 2.2
    >> RMSE = 3.5

this is technically more concise than just printing out the results using two lines of code. For example, we would of needed to do the following:

    bias = 'bias = 2.2'
    rmse = 'RMSE = 3.5'
    print(bias)
    print(rmse)
    >> bias = 2.2
    >> RMSE = 3.5

The example below shows a combination of a new line character (\n) and a tab (\t) within the same string:

    forecast = "Today's weather in Salt Lake City will see a high temperature of 94\n\t with partly cloudy skies"
    print(forecast)
    
    >> Today's weather in Salt Lake City will see a high temperature of 94
           with partly cloudy skies

Finally, there may also be situations where you will need to include special characters such as \n and \t as 'literals'. To treat these special characters as literals, just add a leading forward slash \ before the character. For example:

    print('Hello \\n there!')
    >> Hello \n there
    
    print(print('Hello \n there!')    #No leading slash example....
    >> Hello
         there
         
         
As an alternative option, you can also add a leading 'r' to define the entire string as a literal.
    
    Hello \n there\'!
    >> Hello \n there\'!
